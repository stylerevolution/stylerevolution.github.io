<h1>Paris vs. London</h1>
	<p class="about">Many of the fashions depicted in the <i>Journal des Dames et des Modes</i> from 1797-1804 are strikingly radical and uniquely Parisian. Comparing <i>JDM</i> plates to fashions from British journals printed in London reinforces these claims, but also shows commonalities between the two warring countries. The infographic below (<a href="/Paris_v_London.pdf">click to enlarge</a>) draws comparisons between <i>JDM</i> and two British journals:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Gallery of Fashion: </i>Published from 1794 to 1803 by Nicholas Heideloff. Two plates featuring 1-3 figures each appeared monthly with accompanying descriptions.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li><i>The Fashions of London and Paris: </i>Published monthly from 1798 to 1806 with 2-3 plates of London fashions. Almost every month also included a plate titled "Parisian Fashions" that directly copied fashions from <i>JDM</i> with minor changes.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="about"> It is notable that British fashion plates <i>only</i> depicted women's fashions during this period, never men, and figures rarely appeared alone. Even when <i>The Fashions of London and Paris</i> copied <i>JDM</i> plates, they arranged two or more figures on the page - it would be highly improper for a woman to be out and about on her own!</p>
