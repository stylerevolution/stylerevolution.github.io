<h1>Mapping the Journal des Dames et des Modes</h1>
<div><br>
    <p class="about">This map documents the fashion hotspots mentioned on 38 individual plates of the Journal des Dames et des Modes. In the earliest and most radical years of the Journal, 1797-1798, these individual plates cite 18 specific locations in Paris where the fashions illustrated were seen. Unlike any other fashion plates from the period, these plates depict women alone in the streets and public spaces of Paris. The locations mentioned by the Journal are mainly theaters and parks—public spaces of spectacle and display concentrated around the northwestern part of Paris. While a few of these places can still be seen today, many have disappeared. By reconstructing the relationship between these spaces, we are able to better understand the proximity of these places of fashionable sociability in revolutionary Paris.</p><br>
